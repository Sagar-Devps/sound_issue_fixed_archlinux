WHEN THE SOUND DOESNOT WORK IN ARCHLINUX AND HAVE TO RETSART THE PIPEWIRE MANAULLY EVERYTIME YOU LOGIN THEN FOLLOWING CAN BE THE POSSIBLE SOLUTION
1. Create a Custom Restart Script
First, let's create a small script that will restart PipeWire.
nano ~/.config/systemd/user/pipewire-restart.sh
Add the following content to the script:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
# Sleep for a few seconds to allow system components to start
sleep 5
# Restart pipewire and pipewire-pulse
systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse

2.Save and exit. Now make the script executable:
chmod +x ~/.config/systemd/user/pipewire-restart.sh

3.Create a Systemd Service for the Script
Next, create a systemd service that runs the script after login:
nano ~/.config/systemd/user/pipewire-restart.service
Add the following content to the service file:

[Unit]
Description=Restart PipeWire and PipeWire Pulse after login
After=graphical-session.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/<username>/.config/systemd/user/pipewire-restart.sh
Type=oneshot

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target

4.Enable the Custom Service
Now enable the service to start after login:
systemctl --user enable pipewire-restart.service

5.Reboot and test
